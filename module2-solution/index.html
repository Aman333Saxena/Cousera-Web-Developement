                <h2>Proper Hygiene</h2>
                <p>
                    Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

                <h2>Cover your Face</h2>
                <p>
                    Cover your face with a cloth face covering in public spaces, such as the grocery store, where it's difficult to avoid close contact with others, especially if you're in an area with ongoing community spread. Only use nonmedical cloth masks â€” surgical masks and N95 respirators should be reserved for health care providers. Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue.

                <p>
                    Stay home as much as possible and keep distance between yourself and others (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) if COVID-19 is spreading in your community, especially if you have a higher risk of serious illness. Keep in mind some people may have COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if they don't have symptoms or don't know they have COVID-19. Remember, we all are in this together and only with overall support of every individual we'll come out victorious.
